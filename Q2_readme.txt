For Question 2, we employed an abstract class for the "WorldObject" to generalize the three kinds of objects in the world, but force the user to either choose between Immovable and Movable objects.

Furthermore, we used to the principles of encapsulation to ensure that WorldObjects were blind to their environment, but the World object that they resided in was the sole object that could move them about.

A test world that runs for 100 iterations, as per the guidelines in the assignment, can be found by running World.java (it contains a main() method for demonstration purposes).
